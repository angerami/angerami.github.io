This is a test post for LaTeX rendering. Generated by AI.

Some inline math: $E = mc^2$ and $\hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s.

A display equation:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi
$$

The Schrödinger equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)
$$

Test macro: A vector space over $\RR$ has dimension $n$.

Attention: $\attn(\QQ, \KK, \VV) = \softmax\left(\frac{\QQ\KK^T}{\sqrt{\dk}}\right)\VV$

Query vectors $\vv{q}_i \in \RR^{\dmodel}$ with $\EE[x] = \mu$. rt3

That's it for now.
