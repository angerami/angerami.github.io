## Selected Machine Learning Projects

### **Particle Reconstruction**
Developed CNNs and graph neural networks to reconstruct particles using multi-modal signals from particle detectors using different technologies. Achieved 50% improvement in energy resolution and reduced false positive rate by 10x while maintaining >95% recall in classifying particle type.
*Publications: [CNNs](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2825379), [Graph Neural Networks](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2724632)*

### **AI-Assisted Detector Design**
Cast design of future particle detectors as a formal optimization problem, improving energy resolution by 40% over baseline designs while establishing a new tool for choosing design parameters.
*Publications: [Segmentation Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04442), [SiPM-on-Tile ZDC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12877)*

### **Generative Modeling**
Developed generative models as fast surrogates for detector simulation utilizing diffusion models to generate point-cloud and image representations of calorimeter showers with minimal fidelity loss. Point-cloud models achieve better performance with 4x faster generation time.
*Publication: [Point Cloud vs Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04780)*
