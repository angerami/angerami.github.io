I am a research scientist deploying my background and experience as a physicist to problems in artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on understanding the deep connections between statistical physics and modern AI architectures.

## Research Background

My research career began in particle and nuclear physics, first at Columbia University and later leading a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Most of my experimental work was conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, where I served as a scientific leader within large international collaborations, providing the vision and coordination necessary to execute groundbreaking measurements. 

My most impactful contribution was leading the [observation of centrality-dependent dijet asymmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6182)—the first measurement in heavy-ion collisions using fully reconstructed jets. This pioneering work, which I conceptualized and guided through the complex challenges of execution within the ATLAS collaboration, ushered in the LHC era of heavy-ion physics and established a new pillar in our understanding of the quark-gluon plasma.

Through over a decade of research in high-energy physics, I developed expertise in:
- Leading complex scientific projects within large international collaborations
- Statistical analysis of complex, high-dimensional datasets
- Machine learning applications to particle detection and classification  
- Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and photonuclear processes
- Jet physics and quark-gluon plasma characterization
- Uncertainty quantification and precision measurement techniques

Beyond technical execution, I served as a thought leader who provided scientific vision for ambitious measurement programs. The challenges of these pioneering measurements sparked my interest in methodical approaches to uncertainty quantification. The following years of my career were marked by developing and leveraging new measurement techniques for evaluating precision uncertainties to answer specific, well-posed physics questions—work that required coordinating teams of physicists and establishing new experimental paradigms.

## Current Focus: Physics Meets AI

Having established myself as a leader in experimental physics, I am now eager to apply these analytical abilities and leadership experience to new domains, especially at the interface between technology and humanity. I've discovered fascinating connections between the mathematical frameworks that describe physical systems and those underlying artificial intelligence.

My current research explores what I call the "Transformer-Spin Correspondence"—the remarkable similarity between transformer neural networks and spin glass systems from statistical physics. This perspective opens new avenues for understanding why large language models work so effectively and suggests physics-inspired approaches for improving AI architectures.

## Personal Motivation

My deepest insights into learning and intelligence came from an unexpected source: becoming a father. Watching my children's neurological development from early stages revealed the staggering complexity required to build a human mind. When we study adult learning, we're examining sophisticated processes running on mature neural hardware. But witnessing intelligence emerge from scratch—watching a brain bootstrap itself into consciousness—illuminated that understanding learning isn't just academic curiosity. It's essential for navigating the profound questions at the intersection of artificial and human intelligence.

## Research Philosophy

I believe the most important scientific breakthroughs come from recognizing deep connections between seemingly disparate fields. My goal is to bridge the conceptual gap between fundamental physics and artificial intelligence, translating insights from decades of statistical physics research into practical advances in AI systems.

Whether unraveling the mysteries of quark confinement or understanding how neural networks learn, the underlying challenge remains the same: extracting meaning from complex, high-dimensional data and discovering the elegant mathematical structures that govern apparently disordered systems.
